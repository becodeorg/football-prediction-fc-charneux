Title: Airflow DAG for Model Retraining
---

As a **Data Analyst**,
I want to **create an Airflow DAG to automate the retraining of the machine learning model**,
so that **the prediction model remains accurate with the latest data.**

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  An Airflow DAG file named `training_dag.py` is created in the `dags/` directory.
2.  The `training_dag.py` defines a DAG that schedules the execution of the `src/data_analysis/model.py` script's `train_model()` function.
3.  The DAG is configured to run at a specified frequency (e.g., weekly or after significant data updates).
4.  The DAG includes appropriate error handling and logging for the model training task.
5.  The DAG successfully triggers the `train_model()` function, and the `prediction_model.pkl` file is updated with the newly trained model.

### Dev Notes

*   **File Locations**: The DAG file will be `dags/training_dag.py`. The `model.py` script is located in `src/data_analysis/model.py`. The `prediction_model.pkl` file is expected in the project root. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#3.2. Data Science]
*   **Technology Stack**: Python, Apache Airflow. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#5. Technology Stack]
*   **Testing Requirements**: The DAG should be tested within an Airflow environment to ensure it runs successfully, triggers the model training, and updates the model file. Logging should be checked for errors. [Source: docs/prd.md#8.2. Story 3.2: Airflow DAG for Model Retraining]
*   **Technical Constraints**: The DAG should be designed to be idempotent. The frequency of execution needs to be determined based on model accuracy requirements and data update frequency. [Source: docs/prd.md#4.4. Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests]

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Create `dags/training_dag.py`**: Create the Airflow DAG file. (AC: 1)
- [ ] **Define Airflow DAG**: Implement the DAG structure, including imports, default arguments, and scheduling. (AC: 2, 3)
- [ ] **Define PythonOperator for model training**: Create an Airflow `PythonOperator` to execute the `src/data_analysis/model.py` script's `train_model()` function. (AC: 2)
- [ ] **Implement error handling and logging**: Add appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms within the DAG. (AC: 4)
- [ ] **Test DAG locally (if possible)**: Verify the DAG syntax and basic functionality using Airflow's local testing tools.
- [ ] **Deploy DAG to Airflow environment**: Deploy the DAG to a running Airflow instance.
- [ ] **Monitor DAG execution**: Verify that the DAG runs at the specified frequency and successfully triggers the model retraining. (AC: 5)
- [ ] **Verify model file update**: Check that `prediction_model.pkl` is updated after DAG execution. (AC: 5)
