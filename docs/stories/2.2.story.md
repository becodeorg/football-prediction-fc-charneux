Story: Story 2.2
Title: Prediction Service Implementation
---

As a **Data Analyst**,
I want to **implement a function to load the trained model and make predictions**,
so that **the Streamlit app can easily get match outcome predictions.**

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `model.py` script includes a function `predict_outcome(match_data)` that loads the `prediction_model.pkl`.
2.  The `predict_outcome()` function takes new match data (e.g., features of an upcoming match) as input.
3.  The `predict_outcome()` function returns the predicted outcome (H, D, or A) for the given match data.
4.  The `predict_outcome()` function handles cases where the model file is not found, providing an informative error.

### Dev Notes

*   **File Locations**: The `model.py` script is located in `src/data_analysis/model.py`. The `prediction_model.pkl` file is expected in the project root. [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md#3.2.-data-science]
*   **Data Models**: The `predict_outcome()` function will take `match_data` as input. This input should be a dictionary or a Pandas DataFrame row containing the features required by the trained model (e.g., `FTHG`, `FTAG`, `HS`, `AS`, etc.). The output will be a single prediction (H, D, or A). [Source: docs/prd/7-epic-2-prediction-model-core-dashboard.md#7.2.-story-2.2-prediction-service-implementation]
*   **Technology Stack**: Python, `pickle` (for loading the model), `pandas` (for data handling), `scikit-learn` (or whatever library was used for training). [Source: architecture/5-technology-stack.md#5.-technology-stack]
*   **Testing Requirements**: The `predict_outcome()` function should be executable independently with sample match data to verify correct model loading and prediction. Test cases should include scenarios where the model file is missing. [Source: docs/prd/7-epic-2-prediction-model-core-dashboard.md#7.2.-story-2.2-prediction-service-implementation]
*   **Technical Constraints**: The function must load the model trained in Story 2.1. Ensure consistency in feature names and order between training and prediction. [Source: docs/prd/4-technical-assumptions.md#4.4.-additional-technical-assumptions-and-requests]

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Review `src/data_analysis/model.py`**: Ensure the existing `predict_outcome` placeholder aligns with the requirements. (AC: 1)
- [x] **Implement model loading**: Write/verify Python code in `predict_outcome()` to load `prediction_model.pkl` using `pickle`. (AC: 1)
- [x] **Implement prediction logic**: Use the loaded model to make predictions based on the input `match_data`. (AC: 2, 3)
- [x] **Add error handling for missing model file**: Implement a `try-except` block to catch `FileNotFoundError` when loading the model. (AC: 4)
- [x] **Ensure input data format compatibility**: Verify that the `match_data` input to `predict_outcome()` is correctly processed and aligned with the model's expected features. (AC: 2)
- [x] **Test `predict_outcome()` execution**: Run the function with sample match data and verify the predicted outcome. (AC: 3) *(Tested error handling due to missing model)*
- [x] **Test error handling**: Verify that the function handles the case of a missing model file gracefully. (AC: 4)

### Dev Agent Record

#### Agent Model Used: Gemini

#### Debug Log References:
- `python src/data_analysis/model.py` execution output for `predict_outcome` testing.

#### Completion Notes List:
- Implemented `predict_outcome()` function in `src/data_analysis/model.py`.
- Included model loading and prediction logic.
- Added robust error handling for missing model file.
- Tested error handling for missing model file (as Story 2.1 is blocked).
- Note: Full functional testing of prediction logic requires `prediction_model.pkl` from Story 2.1.

#### File List:
- `src/data_analysis/model.py`

#### Change Log:
- 2025-07-27: Initial implementation of `predict_outcome()` in `model.py`. (DataDev)

### QA Results

**Final Story Validation Report for Story 2.2: Prediction Service Implementation**

**Quick Summary:**
- Story readiness: READY
- Clarity score: 9/10
- Major gaps identified: None (known dependency on Story 2.1)

**Category Statuses:**

| Category                             | Status | Issues |
| :----------------------------------- | :----- | :----- |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS   |        |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS   |        |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS   |        |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS   |        |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PASS   |        |

**Specific Issues (if any):**
- None. The story is well-defined and provides sufficient context for implementation. The dependency on Story 2.1 for a fully functional model is clearly documented.

**Developer Perspective:**
- Could YOU implement this story as written? Yes, the implementation of the `predict_outcome` function itself is complete.
- What questions would you have? None regarding the `predict_outcome` function itself.
- What might cause delays or rework? The continued blocking of Story 1.1 and subsequently Story 2.1 will prevent full end-to-end testing of the prediction service.

**Final Assessment:**
- **READY**: The story provides sufficient context for implementation and is complete, acknowledging its dependency.
