Title: "Feature: Add Team Form Score to Model"
Story: "As a user, I want the prediction model to consider the current form of a team, so that the predictions are more accurate and reflect the team's recent momentum."
Acceptance Criteria:
  - A new "form score" must be calculated for each team before making a prediction.
  - The form score is based on the last 6 matches played by the team.
  - The calculation uses a weighted point system:
    - Win: 3 points, Draw: 1 point, Loss: 0 points.
    - The most recent match has a weight of 1.0.
    - The second most recent match has a weight of 0.8.
    - The third most recent match has a weight of 0.6.
    - The fourth most recent match has a weight of 0.4.
    - The fifth most recent match has a weight of 0.2.
    - The oldest match (6th) has a weight of 0.1.
  - The final score is normalized to a scale of 10. The maximum possible weighted score is 11.1 (6 wins with weights). Formula: `(Weighted Score / 11.1) * 10`.
  - The form score must be added as a new feature (column) to the dataset used for training and prediction.
  - The existing model training and prediction scripts must be updated to use this new feature.
Dev Notes:
  - A new function to calculate the form score will be needed. This function will take a team's match history as input.
  - The data processing pipeline needs to be modified to call this function and add the score to the dataset.
  - Ensure the calculation is performed for both the home and away team for each match being predicted.
