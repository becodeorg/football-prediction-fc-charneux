Title: Streamlit Dashboard - Upcoming Matches & Predictions
---

As a **Data Analyst**,
I want to **display upcoming matches and their predicted outcomes on the Streamlit dashboard**,
so that **users can quickly see the system's predictions.**

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `app.py` Streamlit application displays a clear header for "Upcoming Matches".
2.  The `app.py` connects to `football.db` and retrieves the next 3 upcoming matches (based on date).
3.  For each upcoming match, the `app.py` calls the `predict_outcome()` function from `model.py` to get the prediction.
4.  The dashboard clearly displays the home team, away team, and the predicted outcome for each of the 3 upcoming matches.
5.  The dashboard gracefully handles cases where no upcoming matches are found in the database.

### Dev Notes

*   **File Locations**: The `app.py` script is located in `src/data_analysis/app.py`. [Source: architecture/3-component-breakdown.md#3.3.-frontend]
*   **Data Models**: The `app.py` will connect to `football.db` to retrieve upcoming match data. It will utilize the `predict_outcome()` function from `src/data_analysis/model.py` to get predictions. [Source: docs/prd/7-epic-2-prediction-model-core-dashboard.md#7.3.-story-2.3-streamlit-dashboard---upcoming-matches-predictions]
*   **Technology Stack**: Python, Streamlit, `sqlite3`, `pandas`. [Source: architecture/5-technology-stack.md#5.-technology-stack]
*   **Testing Requirements**: The Streamlit application should be run locally to verify the display of the "Upcoming Matches" header, correct retrieval and display of the next 3 matches, and accurate calling and display of predictions. Test with an empty database to ensure graceful handling. [Source: docs/prd/7-epic-2-prediction-model-core-dashboard.md#7.3.-story-2.3-streamlit-dashboard---upcoming-matches-predictions]
*   **Technical Constraints**: Display only the next 3 upcoming matches.

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Review `src/data_analysis/app.py`**: Ensure the existing placeholder script aligns with the requirements. (AC: 1)
- [x] **Implement Streamlit header**: Add the "Upcoming Matches" header to the `app.py` script. (AC: 1)
- [x] **Connect to database and retrieve matches**: Write code to connect to `football.db` and fetch the next 3 upcoming matches. (AC: 2) *(Blocked by Story 1.1 - gracefully handles missing table)*
- [x] **Integrate prediction service**: For each retrieved match, call the `predict_outcome()` function from `model.py`. (AC: 3) *(Blocked by Story 1.1 - `predict_outcome` fails due to missing model)*
- [x] **Display match details and predictions**: Present the home team, away team, and predicted outcome clearly on the dashboard. (AC: 4) *(Blocked by Story 1.1 - no matches to display)*
- [x] **Implement graceful handling for no matches**: Add logic to display a message if no upcoming matches are found. (AC: 5)
- [x] **Test Streamlit application**: Run `streamlit run src/data_analysis/app.py` and verify all acceptance criteria. (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) *(Tested, but full functionality blocked by Story 1.1)*

### Dev Agent Record

#### Agent Model Used: Gemini

#### Debug Log References:
- `streamlit run src/data_analysis/app.py` execution output.

#### Completion Notes List:
- Created `src/data_analysis/app.py` with Streamlit dashboard structure.
- Implemented header display and graceful handling for no upcoming matches.
- Integrated `predict_outcome` call, but full functionality is blocked by Story 1.1 (missing `football.db` and `matches` table).
- Added `__init__.py` files to `src` and `src/data_analysis` to resolve import errors.
- Added explicit `sys.path` modification in `app.py` for robust imports.

#### File List:
- `src/data_analysis/app.py`
- `src/__init__.py`
- `src/data_analysis/__init__.py`

#### Change Log:
- 2025-07-27: Initial implementation of `app.py` and import fixes. (Dev)

### QA Results

**Final Story Validation Report for Story 2.3: Streamlit Dashboard - Upcoming Matches & Predictions**

**Quick Summary:**
- Story readiness: READY (for integration with completed dependencies)
- Clarity score: 9/10
- Major gaps identified: Full functionality blocked by Story 1.1.

**Category Statuses:**

| Category                             | Status | Issues |
| :----------------------------------- | :----- | :----- |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS   |        |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS   |        |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS   |        |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS   |        |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PASS   |        |

**Specific Issues (if any):**
- Full functional testing and display of actual upcoming matches and predictions are blocked by the incomplete Story 1.1 (Database Setup and Historical Data Ingestion).

**Developer Perspective:**
- Could YOU implement this story as written? Yes, the code is implemented as per the story's scope, with graceful handling for missing dependencies.
- What questions would you have? None regarding the current scope.
- What might cause delays or rework? The resolution of Story 1.1 is critical for this story to show actual data and predictions.

**Final Assessment:**
- **READY**: The story provides sufficient context and its implementation is complete within its current scope, acknowledging its dependencies.
