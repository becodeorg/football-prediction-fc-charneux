Title: Airflow DAG for Data Scraping
---

As a **Data Engineer**,
I want to **create an Airflow DAG to automate the execution of the web scraper**,
so that **the betting odds and recent match data are regularly updated in the database.**

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  An Airflow DAG file named `scraping_dag.py` is created in the `dags/` directory.
2.  The `scraping_dag.py` defines a DAG that schedules the execution of the `src/data_engineering/scraper.py` script.
3.  The DAG is configured to run at a specified frequency (e.g., daily or hourly, to be determined by the team).
4.  The DAG includes appropriate error handling and logging for the scraping task.
5.  The DAG successfully triggers the `scraper.py` script, and the scraped data is inserted/updated in the `football.db` database.

### Dev Notes

*   **File Locations**: The DAG file will be `dags/scraping_dag.py`. The `scraper.py` script is located in `src/data_engineering/scraper.py`. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#3.1. Data Engineering]
*   **Technology Stack**: Python, Apache Airflow. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#5. Technology Stack]
*   **Testing Requirements**: The DAG should be tested within an Airflow environment to ensure it runs successfully, triggers the scraper, and updates the database. Logging should be checked for errors. [Source: docs/prd.md#8.1. Story 3.1: Airflow DAG for Data Scraping]
*   **Technical Constraints**: The DAG should be designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing data duplication or corruption. The frequency of execution needs to be determined based on data freshness requirements. [Source: docs/prd.md#4.4. Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests]

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Create `dags/scraping_dag.py`**: Create the Airflow DAG file. (AC: 1)
- [ ] **Define Airflow DAG**: Implement the DAG structure, including imports, default arguments, and scheduling. (AC: 2, 3)
- [ ] **Define PythonOperator for scraper**: Create an Airflow `PythonOperator` to execute the `src/data_engineering/scraper.py` script. (AC: 2)
- [ ] **Implement error handling and logging**: Add appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms within the DAG. (AC: 4)
- [ ] **Test DAG locally (if possible)**: Verify the DAG syntax and basic functionality using Airflow's local testing tools.
- [ ] **Deploy DAG to Airflow environment**: Deploy the DAG to a running Airflow instance.
- [ ] **Monitor DAG execution**: Verify that the DAG runs at the specified frequency and successfully triggers the scraper. (AC: 5)
- [ ] **Verify database updates**: Check `football.db` to confirm that scraped data is being inserted/updated correctly. (AC: 5)
