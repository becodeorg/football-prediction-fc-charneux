## 2. Information Architecture (IA)

Collaborate with the user to create a comprehensive information architecture:

1. Build a Site Map or Screen Inventory showing all major areas
2. Define the Navigation Structure (primary, secondary, breadcrumbs)
3. Use Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
4. Consider user mental models and expected groupings

## 3. User Flows

For each critical user task identified in the PRD:

1. Define the user's goal clearly
2. Map out all steps including decision points
3. Consider edge cases and error states
4. Use Mermaid flow diagrams for clarity
5. Link to external tools (Figma/Miro) if detailed flows exist there

Create subsections for each major flow.

## 4. Wireframes & Mockups

Clarify where detailed visual designs will be created (Figma, Sketch, etc.) and how to reference them. If low-fidelity wireframes are needed, offer to help conceptualize layouts for key screens.

## 5. Component Library / Design System

Discuss whether to use an existing design system or create a new one. If creating new, identify foundational components and their key states. Note that detailed technical specs belong in front-end-architecture.

## 6. Branding & Style Guide

Link to existing style guide or define key brand elements. Ensure consistency with company brand guidelines if they exist.

## 7. Accessibility Requirements

Define specific accessibility requirements based on target compliance level and user needs. Be comprehensive but practical.

## 8. Responsiveness Strategy

Define breakpoints and adaptation strategies for different device sizes. Consider both technical constraints and user contexts.

## 9. Animation & Micro-interactions

Define motion design principles and key interactions. Keep performance and accessibility in mind.

## 10. Performance Considerations

Define performance goals and strategies that impact UX design decisions.

## 11. Next Steps

After completing the UI/UX specification:

1. Recommend review with stakeholders
2. Suggest creating/updating visual designs in design tool
3. Prepare for handoff to Design Architect for frontend architecture
4. Note any open questions or decisions needed
