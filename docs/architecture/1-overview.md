# 1. Overview

This document outlines the architecture for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Football Match Prediction system. The design prioritizes simplicity, clear separation of concerns, and the use of a lightweight, Python-based stack to meet the project's core requirements.

The system is composed of three main components:
1.  **Data Engineering Pipeline**: Responsible for collecting and storing data.
2.  **Data Science Pipeline**: Responsible for training and serving the prediction model.
3.  **Frontend Application**: Responsible for displaying the predictions and data to the user.
