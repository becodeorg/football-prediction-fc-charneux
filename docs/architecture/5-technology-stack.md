# 5. Technology Stack

-   **Language**: Python
-   **Frontend**: Streamlit
-   **Data Storage**: SQLite
-   **Data Scraping**: Playwright, BeautifulSoup, Requests
-   **ML/Data Science**: Pandas, Scikit-learn (or similar)
-   **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow

This architecture is designed to be simple to implement for the MVP, while also being modular enough to allow for future evolution, such as replacing SQLite with a more robust database or deploying the prediction service as a separate API.
