# ML Model Specification: Football Match Prediction Model

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the strategy for the Machine Learning (ML) model within the Football Match Prediction Project. The model will predict Belgian Jupiler Pro League football match outcomes by leveraging historical data and real-time scraped betting odds. It will be integrated into a Python-based monolith architecture, with predictions displayed on a Streamlit dashboard. The strategy focuses on model training, persistence, and automated retraining to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## Problem Definition

### Business Problem
Predicting football match outcomes is a complex task due to numerous variables and inherent unpredictability. Existing solutions often lack real-time data integration, comprehensive team statistics, or an intuitive visualization interface. This project aims to address these pain points by providing a robust, automated system that combines historical trends with live data to offer more accurate and timely predictions, thereby enhancing the user's understanding and engagement with football analytics.

### Success Metrics
- Achieve a predictive accuracy rate of X% for match outcomes (to be defined during model training and evaluation).
- Prediction Accuracy: Percentage of correctly predicted match outcomes.

### Constraints
- Budget: Free hosting services preferred for the database.
- Timeline: 8 days duration, deadline 13/09/2024 5PM.
- Resources: Team of 4 learners.
- Technical: Reliance on provided historical dataset and specified scraping sources.

## Data Requirements

### Training Data
- **Source**: `football.db` (SQLite database containing historical match data from `football-data.co.uk` CSV and scraped betting odds/recent match data).
- **Volume**: Historical data (initial load) + ongoing updates from scraping.
- **Features**: Features derived from `matches` table (Date, Time, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG, FTAG, FTR, and additional statistics/odds).
- **Target Variable**: `FTR` (Full Time Result: Home Win, Draw, Away Win).
- **Data Quality**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, consistency checks will be performed during preprocessing.

### Feature Engineering
(To be detailed during implementation, but will include features derived from match statistics, team performance, and odds.)

## Model Architecture

### Algorithm Selection
**Selected Algorithm**: Scikit-learn (e.g., RandomForestClassifier) or XGBoost

**Rationale**: These algorithms are well-suited for classification tasks, robust to various data types, and provide good interpretability. They are standard in the data science community and align with the Python-based technology stack.

### Model Configuration
- **Model Type**: Classification Model
- **Hyperparameters**: To be tuned during model development.
- **Training Strategy**: Train on combined historical and recent data. Periodic retraining via Airflow DAG.
- **Validation Strategy**: Cross-validation during training, evaluation on a held-out test set.

## Performance Requirements

### Accuracy Metrics
- **Primary Metric**: Prediction Accuracy (percentage of correctly predicted match outcomes).
- **Target Performance**: X% (to be defined during model training and evaluation).
- **Baseline Performance**: To be established after initial data analysis.

### Operational Requirements
- **Inference Latency**: Predictions should be near real-time for the Streamlit dashboard.
- **Throughput**: Capable of handling predictions for upcoming matches.
- **Availability**: Model serving should be highly available for the Streamlit dashboard.

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure
- **Platform**: Python environment, model file (`.pkl`) stored locally or in a designated `models/` directory.
- **Scaling Strategy**: Not applicable for MVP (single model instance). Future consideration for API deployment.
- **Resource Requirements**: Minimal for model serving.

### Monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor prediction accuracy over time.
- **Data Drift Detection**: Not explicitly defined for MVP, but important for future iterations.
- **Model Decay Monitoring**: Monitor model performance degradation over time.

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Model Accuracy: Achieving satisfactory prediction accuracy within the given timeframe.
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Focus on well-established ML algorithms, thorough data preprocessing, and continuous evaluation.

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: User adoption if predictions are not consistently accurate.
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Clearly communicate model limitations, focus on transparency of data and predictions.
