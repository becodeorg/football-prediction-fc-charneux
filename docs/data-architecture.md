# Football Match Prediction Project Data Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Football Match Prediction Project, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a greenfield project. No specific starter template is being used, but the project will be developed within a single GitHub repository (`football-prediction`) as a Python-based monolith.

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-07-27 | 1.0 | Initial Draft based on PRD and Frontend Spec | Architect |

## 2. High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

This system's overall architecture is a Python-based monolith, designed to predict football match outcomes. It comprises a data engineering pipeline for data collection and storage, a data science pipeline for model training and prediction, and a Streamlit-based frontend for displaying results. The architecture prioritizes simplicity and clear separation of concerns to support the MVP goals of data-driven insights and interactive visualization.

### High Level Overview

1.  **Main Architectural Style:** Monolith (Python-based)
2.  **Repository Structure:** Monorepo (`football-prediction`)
3.  **Service Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns between data engineering (scraping, database, Airflow) and data analysis (ML model, Streamlit app) components, residing within the same codebase.
4.  **Primary Data Flow:** Data flows from external sources (CSV, scraped websites) into an SQLite database, then to the ML model for training and prediction, and finally displayed on the Streamlit dashboard.
5.  **Key Architectural Decisions:** Use of SQLite for simplicity in MVP, Python for unified language, and Airflow for orchestration.

### Architectural and Design Patterns

-   **Monolithic Architecture:** For simplicity and ease of deployment in the MVP. _Rationale:_ Aligns with the project's initial scope and resource constraints.
-   **Repository Pattern:** To abstract data access logic. _Rationale:_ Enables easier testing and potential future migration to different database systems without significant code changes.
-   **Data Pipeline Pattern:** For structured data ingestion, processing, and delivery. _Rationale:_ Ensures data quality, consistency, and automates the flow from source to consumption.
