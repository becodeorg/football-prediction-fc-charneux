# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## 3.1. Overall UX Vision

The overall UX vision is to provide a clear, intuitive, and data-rich experience for football enthusiasts, bettors, and data science students. The dashboard should be easy to navigate, visually appealing, and effectively present complex data in an understandable format. The primary goal is to enable users to quickly grasp match predictions, team performance, and betting odds.

## 3.2. Key Interaction Paradigms

The primary interaction paradigm will be a dashboard-style interface, allowing users to view information at a glance. Interactions will be focused on consuming information, with potential for filtering or sorting upcoming matches if the MVP expands.

## 3.3. Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens or views necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals are:

*   **Main Dashboard**: This will be the central view displaying upcoming matches, predictions, odds, and team statistics.

## 3.4. Accessibility: None

*Assumption: For the MVP, accessibility will not be a primary focus beyond what Streamlit provides out-of-the-box. This can be revisited in future phases.*

## 3.5. Branding

*Assumption: No specific branding elements or style guides are provided for the MVP. The design will follow a clean, modern aesthetic, leveraging Streamlit's default styling. This can be defined in future phases.*

## 3.6. Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

*Assumption: The primary target platform is web, with a responsive design to ensure usability across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile browsers). No dedicated mobile or desktop applications are planned for the MVP.*
