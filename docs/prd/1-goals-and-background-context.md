# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   Predict Belgian Jupiler Pro League football match outcomes.
*   Combine historical data with real-time scraped information (odds, recent matches).
*   Present predictions via a Streamlit dashboard.
*   Provide users with data-driven insights and a visual representation of predictions and team statistics.
*   Offer an end-to-end solution for football match prediction, from data ingestion and model training to interactive visualization.
*   Enable users to make informed decisions or simply enjoy data-driven insights into football matches.

## Background Context

The Football Match Prediction project aims to address the complexity of predicting football match outcomes, which often lack real-time data integration, comprehensive team statistics, or an intuitive visualization interface in existing solutions. This project will provide a robust, automated system that combines historical trends with live data to offer more accurate and timely predictions, enhancing user understanding and engagement with football analytics. The solution will leverage web scraping, a machine learning model, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard, with the entire data pipeline automated using Airflow.
